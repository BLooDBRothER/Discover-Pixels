# PixDiscovery

## About the Project

This is my first *_React_* project. I developed a photo and video search web app powered by *_pixabay API_*. The site is even responsive you can take a look at your mobile. I developed for my learning purpose.

* React Routing
* React Responsive
* IntersectionObserver (Infinite scrolling)
* Pixabay API
* SCSS

## To run this locally

Step 2: Create .env file in the root directory
```sh
touch .env
```
and paste the following line by replacing the key
```

```

step 3: Clone and run.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BLooDBRothER/PixDiscovery.git
